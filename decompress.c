/*
   A rough description of Canon's compression algorithm:

+  Each pixel outputs a 10-bit sample, from 0 to 1023.
+  Split the data into blocks of 64 samples each.
+  Subtract from each sample the value of the sample two positions
   to the left, which has the same color filter.  From the two
   leftmost samples in each row, subtract 512.
+  For each nonzero sample, make a token consisting of two four-bit
   numbers.  The low nibble is the number of bits required to
   represent the sample, and the high nibble is the number of
   zero samples preceding this sample.
+  Output this token as a variable-length bitstring using
   one of three tablesets.  Follow it with a fixed-length
   bitstring containing the sample.

   The "first_decode" table is used for the first sample in each
   block, and the "second_decode" table is used for the others.

   Construct a decode tree according the specification in *source.
   The first 16 bytes specify how many codes should be 1-bit, 2-bit
   3-bit, etc.  Bytes after that are the leaf values.
